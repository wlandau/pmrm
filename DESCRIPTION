Title: Progression Models for Repeated Measures
Description: A progression model for repeated measures (PMRM)
  is a continuous-time nonlinear mixed-effects model for
  longitudinal clinical trials in progressive diseases.
  Unlike mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs),
  which estimate treatment effects as linear combinations
  of additive effects on the outcome scale,
  PMRMs characterize treatment effects
  in terms of the underlying disease trajectory.
  This framing yields clinically interpretable quantities
  such as average time saved
  and percent reduction in decline due to treatment.
  This package implements frequentist PMRMs by
  Raket (2022) <doi:10.1002/sim.9581> using
  'RTMB' by Kristensen (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i05>.
