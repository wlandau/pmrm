A progression model for repeated measures (PMRM) is a continuous-time nonlinear mixed-effects model for longitudinal clinical trials in progressive diseases.
Unlike mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs), which estimate treatment effects as linear combinations of additive effects on the outcome scale, PMRMs characterize treatment effects in terms of the underlying disease trajectory.
This framing yields clinically interpretable quantities such as average time saved and percent reduction in decline due to treatment.
The pmrm package implements the frequentist PMRM framework of @raket2022 using automatic differentiation via [RTMB](https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB) [@kristensen2016].
