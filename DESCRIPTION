Title: Progression Models for Repeated Measures
Description: A progression model for repeated measures (PMRM)
  is a longitudinal continuous-time nonlinear model
  of a progressive disease. Some PMRMs are designed to estimate the treatment
  effect on the time scale, which is often more appropriate and more intuitive
  than the more typical treatment effect on the outcome scale.
  This package implements frequentist PMRMs by
  Raket (2022) <doi:10.1002/sim.9581> using
  'RTMB' by Kristensen (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i05>.
