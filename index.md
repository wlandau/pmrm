A progression model for repeated measures (PMRM) is a continuous-time
nonlinear mixed-effects model for longitudinal clinical trials in
progressive diseases. Unlike mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs),
which estimate treatment effects as linear combinations of additive
effects on the outcome scale, PMRMs characterize treatment effects in
terms of the underlying disease trajectory. This framing yields
clinically interpretable quantities such as average time saved and
percent reduction in decline due to treatment. The pmrm package
implements the frequentist PMRM framework of Raket (2022) using
automatic differentiation via [RTMB](https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB)
(Kristensen et al. 2016).
