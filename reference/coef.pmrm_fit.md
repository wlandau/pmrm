# Treatment effect parameters

Extract the `theta` parameter from a progression model for repeated
measures.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'pmrm_fit'
coef(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A fitted model object of class `"pmrm_fit"`.

- ...:

  Not used.

## Value

For proportional models, a named vector of `theta` estimates with one
element for each active study arm. For non-proportional models, a named
matrix of `theta` with one row for each active study arm and one column
for each post-baseline scheduled visit. Elements, rows, and columns are
named with arm/visit names as appropriate.

## Details

  )
