# Extract the log likelihood.

Extract the maximized log likelihood of a progression model for repeated
measures (PMRM).

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'pmrm_fit'
logLik(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A fitted model object of class `"pmrm_fit"`.

- ...:

  Not used.

## Value

Numeric scalar, the maximized log likelihood of the fitted model.
