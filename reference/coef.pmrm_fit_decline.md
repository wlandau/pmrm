# Nonlinear fixed effects: proportional decline model.

Extract the `theta` parameter vector from the proportional decline
model. `theta` measures decline in the outcome variable in each active
arm relative to control. Does not include the covariate adjustment
parameters `gamma`.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'pmrm_fit_decline'
coef(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A fitted model object of class `"pmrm_fit"` produced by
  [`pmrm_model_decline()`](https://wlandau.github.io/pmrm/reference/pmrm_model_decline.md)
  or
  [`pmrm_model_slowing()`](https://wlandau.github.io/pmrm/reference/pmrm_model_slowing.md).

- ...:

  Not used.

## Value

A named vector of `theta` estimates with one element for each active
study arm. Names indicate the study arms.

## Details
