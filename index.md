# pmrm

A progression model for repeated measures (PMRM) is a longitudinal
continuous-time nonlinear model of a progressive disease. Some PMRMs are
designed to estimate the treatment effect on the time scale, which is
often more appropriate and more intuitive than the more typical
treatment effect on the outcome scale. This package implements
frequentist PMRMs by Raket (2022) using
[TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp) by Kristensen et al. (2016).

# Installation

You can install `pmrm` from GitHub.

``` r
pak::pkg_install("wlandau/pmrm")
```

Please make sure the version of `RTMB` is \>= 1.8.

``` r
packageVersion("RTMB")
#> [1] '1.8'
```

If your version of `RTMB` is too low, please install the latest version
from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("RTMB", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```
